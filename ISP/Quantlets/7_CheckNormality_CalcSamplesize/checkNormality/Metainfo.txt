# Name of QuantLet: ISP_checkNormality.py

# Published in:  An Introduction to Statistics with Python

# Description: Graphical and quantitative check, if a given distribution is normal.
    - For small sample-numbers (<50), you should use the Shapiro-Wilk test or the "normaltest"
    - for intermediate sample numbers, the Lilliefors-test is good since the original Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test is unreliable when mean and std of the distribution
    are not known.
    - the Kolmogorov-Smirnov(Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test should only be used for large sample numbers (>300)
